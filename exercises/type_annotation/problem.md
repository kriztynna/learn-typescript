Write a TypeScript program that compiles to JavaScript that will print "HELLO TYPESCRIPT" to the console.

You'll submit a TypeScript file (.ts), and the verify script will compile it to JavaScript before verifying the submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

TypeScript is a super set of JavaScript. Put another way, all valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript. How would you write to the console if you were using JavaScript? That just might do the trick...

Remember, your solution must be a TypeScript file, not a JavaScript file. To verify, run

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.ts
```
