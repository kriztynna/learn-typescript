Write a Node.js program that prints "HELLO WORLD" to the console.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

Don't worry about TypeScript just yet, we'll get to it very soon. For now, we just want to make sure this workshop is up and running for you.

You don't need deep knowledge of Node.js to learn-typescript, but it helps to have some familiarity. 

As a reminder, writing to the console is as easy as

```js
console.log("your text here")
```

To verify your program, just invoke it with

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

The lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
